For this assignment, I cloned FiveThirtyEight's repository called oscar-ads. The data within the repository was used to write the article called, "Hollywood Studios Barely Promoted Non-White Actors and Films". In seeking to address the issue that the Academy Awards are racists, the news outlet quantified the nomination campaigns by inventorying advertisements featured in magazines prior to the Oscar nomination deadline. This data is made up of 363 ads and the write analyzed ad space and the amount of ads. The article speaks to how advertising buys best picture and lead to acting nominations. There is a trend that films with non-white cast members do not recieve the same amount of advertising space. The write proposes to fix the current nomination system, film companies could begin to actively promote films featuring a diverse cast. I thought this was an interesting data set and story because it turned a wider issue into a data story. FiveThirtyEight had to develop a system that quanified an otherwise very visually based story. Sorting through this data also allowed it to propose a potential solution that would not have been observed without the collection of the data. My question would be about how they measured each add. The data is about the dimensions each advertisement took up within the magazine. Was this manually measured by a single person or did a computer compute the area? I am also curious about the timeline they chose to collect ads from. They chose Nov. - Feb. I wonder if a larger time frame or time around when each movie premiered would yeild different results.
